Tiffane is currently the Apiary Manager for UWA, ensuring the 'bee integrity' of research projects for both the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Honey Bee Products and our Scientific Bee Services endeavour.  She is a fourth generation beekeeper and has been involved in beekeeping in WA for nearly 30 years.  As one of Western Australia's premier Queen breeders, Tiffane worked in the commercial queen breeding sector for six years and ran her own queen rearing business for three of those.  With a BSc (Hons) and 16 years experience in research beekeeping, Tiffane is well placed to guide our work here at UWA.  She has an international perspective with worldwide links to other bee research groups and a Churchill Fellowship on breeding for bee disease resistance under her belt.
